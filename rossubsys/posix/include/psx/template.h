 How to create a new header file from this template:
  - copy the template in the new file (never edit this file directly, unless
    that's what you want)
  - search for the string "EDITME" in the file, and follow the instructions
  - remove this comment block, all blocks containing REMOVEME, and all EDITME
    instructions
  - save your file, and Have Fun! (TM)

 Tags are used to prevent double inclusion of C header files. This
 technique should be documented in all good C manuals

 How to generate an unique tag for your header:
  - uppercase the name of the header, where "name" is the filename and
    the optional relative path (e.g. "stdio.h", "sys/types.h")
  - replace all non-alphanumeric characters in the obtained name with an
    underscore character ("_")
  - prepend a double underscore ("__"), and append the string "_INCLUDED__"
  - replace all occurrences of "__PSX_TEMPLATE_H_INCLUDED__" in this file
    with your tag

 Example tags:
  sys/types.h -> SYS/TYPES.H -> SYS_TYPES_H -> __SYS_TYPES_H_INCLUDED__
  iso646.h -> ISO646.H -> ISO646_H -> __ISO646_H_INCLUDED__
