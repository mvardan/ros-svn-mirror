The Open-Source ReactOS Operating System is aiming to provide an alternative to Microsoft Windows - the currently dominant operating system for Personal Computers on the market - by offering full compatibility with applications and drivers written for it.
As such, existing applications (such as text processing applications) need to be able to use the established API functions to print under ReactOS without recompiling these applications or modifying their code.

This thesis provides an in-depth research on the Printing Stack of the Microsoft Windows Operating System as well as a comparison to other popular Printing Stacks.
The work is followed by the design and an initial implementation of compatible components for the ReactOS Operating System to enable Printing of a prepared data stream in a Printer Control Language using the established Operating System API functions.
This includes printing to real Printers physically connected to a computer as well as employing virtual Printers to write the printing output into a file.
The components are designed in an extensible way to allow for a future addition of driver support for datatype conversions, user interface components and additional Printer Drivers.
